            A machine learning model is a <span className="font-extrabold text-purple-400">software</span> that learns how to do certain tasks based on big amount of data. 
            It is very similar to how humans <span className="font-extrabold text-purple-400">learn</span> new things.
            We get some input(read a lesson, watch tutorial, your mum tells you something), then you try to use the new knowlege, if you do it right then you <span className="font-extrabold text-purple-400">memorize</span> it, if not you mark it as a mistake and try again.

            This process goes on and on untill you are finally sure that you've learned the new <span className="font-extrabold text-purple-400">skill</span>.

            Not into component frameworks and like to keep it old school? Use Tailwind's @apply directive to extract repeated utility patterns into custom CSS classes just by copying and pasting the list of className names. Donâ€™t want to be one of those websites that blinds people when they open it on their phone at 2am? Enable dark mode in your configuration file then throw dark: in front of any color utility to apply it when dark mode is active. Works for background colors, text colors, border colors, and even gradients.
